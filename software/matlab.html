<h1>Accelerating Matlab</h1>

Matlab is a very useful programming environment, but it also has many
inefficiencies.  You might think that these are unavoidable, but in fact it
is possible to fix most of them, without significantly changing your
programs.  This page describes some easy ways to modify the Matlab
environment to make programs run faster.
<p>

<ol>
<li>
Install <a
href="http://documents.epfl.ch/users/l/le/leuteneg/www/MATLABToolbox/DoubleClass.html">Marcel
Leutenegger's package of elementary functions</a>.  They speed up functions
like <kbd>exp</kbd> and <kbd>log</kbd> by a factor of 3 or more, with no
loss of accuracy.  They directly replace the functions in
Matlab, so no program modification is required.
<p>

<li>
Run <kbd>mex -setup</kbd> and select a good compiler.  
The default compiler (<kbd>lcc</kbd>) does not produce very good code.
<p>
To use Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 version 7.1, 
you will first need to install a
<a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/data/1-1BRI9.html?solution=1-1BRI9">patch</a>.
Unfortunately, while Visual Studio 7.1 generally produces good code, it has a 
performance bug in the intrinsic <kbd>exp</kbd> function.  To get around
this, edit the mex options file
(<kbd>C:\MATLAB6p5p1\bin\win32\mexopts\msvc71opts.bat</kbd>) to read:
<pre>set OPTIMFLAGS=/MD -O2 -Oy- /Oi- -DNDEBUG</pre>
<p>
After changing the compiler, you should re-compile your mex files, and
re-install any packages including mex (such as lightspeed).  <p>

<li>
Install 
<a href="lightspeed/">lightspeed</a>.  
It provides optimized implementations of common operations, including a
C replacement for <kbd>repmat.m</kbd>.
<p>

<li>
Profile your code to find bottlenecks:
<pre>
profile on
myfun;
profile report
</pre>

<li>
Avoid loops by writing 'vectorized' code.
See the MathWorks' <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1109.html">Vectorization
Guide</a>,
<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~marios/matlab/matlab_tricks.html">Marios Athineos's tips and tricks</a>,
and the routines in lightspeed (such as <kbd>sqdist</kbd>).

<!--
<li>
The type checking routines (<kbd>isa</kbd>,<kbd>iscell</kbd>,etc.) are
slow and should be used sparingly.
-->
</ol>

<h2>Efficient ways to do common tasks</h2>

<h3>Manipulate sets of integers</h3>

The fastest way to do this is with sparse logical vectors.  If you want to
use sorted arrays of integers instead, beware that the Matlab functions
<kbd>setdiff</kbd>, <kbd>union</kbd>, etc. are not optimized for this case
and will be a bottleneck.  
Optimized functions for the sorted case are
included in <a href="lightspeed/">lightspeed</a>.

<h3>Represent a graph</h3>

Use a sparse logical adjacency matrix, and use matrix operations whenever
possible.  For example, if <kbd>G</kbd> is symmetric (i.e. an undirected
graph) then <kbd>G*G</kbd> gives the number of neighbors in common to nodes
<var>i</var> and <var>j</var>, for all <var>(i,j)</var>.  See <a
href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~murphyk/Software/">Kevin Murphy's graph toolbox</a>.

<h3>Sample random numbers from various distributions</h3>

Use the functions provided in <a href="lightspeed/">lightspeed</a>.

<h3>Read XML</h3>

<a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=1742&objectType=FILE">Peter
Rysadter's XML parser</a>
was the fastest, but is no longer available.
