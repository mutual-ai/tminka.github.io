<h1>Empirical Risk Minimization is an incomplete inductive principle</h1>

Thomas P. Minka<br>
MIT Media Lab note (8/16/00)
<p>

Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) only utilizes the loss function defined
for the task and is completely agnostic about sampling distributions.  Thus
it only covers half of the story.  Furthermore, ERM is equivalent to
Bayesian decision theory with a particular choice of prior.

The connection between frequentist methods and the Dirichlet process is explored further in the paper
<a href="http://www.ism.ac.jp/editsec/aism/pdf/048_4_0663.pdf">Bayesian nonparametric predictive inference and bootstrap techniques</a> by P. Muliere and P. Secchi.  It shows that classical bootstrap techniques are equivalent to assuming a Dirichlet process prior.
