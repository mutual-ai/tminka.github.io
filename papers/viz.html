<h1>Building statistical models by visualization</h1>

Thomas P. Minka<br>

<p>

Practical applications of statistical methods usually involve
assumptions about the domain, such as independence, normality,
linearity, and the choice of variables.  I will describe a set of
graphical tools which simplify the process of learning about a domain
and checking model assumptions.  Some of these tools have been around
for years, but vastly underused by statistical learning researchers.
Using real-world examples, I will illustrate how visualization can be
used for model selection, identifying exceptional cases, and
interpreting the results of learning algorithms.

My visualization software is available: 
<a
href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~tpminka/courses/36-350/lab/mining.zip">mining.zip
(R 1.7.1)</a>
<a
href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~tpminka/courses/36-350/lab/mining_1.1.zip">mining_1.1.zip
(R 1.9.1)</a>
<br>In R for Windows, select menu option 
<pre>
Packages -> Install Package from local zip file...
</pre>
Then type
<pre>
library(mining)
help(package=mining)
</pre>
<p>

These packages only work with the version of R listed.  Under Windows Vista, R has trouble unzipping packages.  In this case, you need to manually unzip the package into the R/library directory.
