The generative aspect model is an extension of the multinomial model for
text that allows word probabilities to vary stochastically across
documents.  Previous results with aspect models have been promising, but
hindered by the computational difficulty of carrying out inference and
learning.  This paper demonstrates that the simple variational methods of
Blei et al (2001) can lead to inaccurate inferences and biased learning
for the generative aspect model.  We develop an alternative approach that
leads to higher accuracy at comparable cost.  An extension of
Expectation-Propagation is used for inference and then embedded in an EM
algorithm for learning.  Experimental results are presented for both
synthetic and real data sets.

<h3>Software</h3>

A Matlab implementation of VB and EP is available:
<a href="minka-aspect.zip">minka-aspect.zip</a>
<br>
It requires <a
href="https://github.com/tminka/lightspeed/">lightspeed</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/tminka/fastfit/">fastfit</a>, so install these first.
