<h1>Optical character recognition papers</h1>

This is work I did as a summer intern at Xerox PARC in the Document
Image Decoding Group.  Document Image Decoding is a probabilistic
modeling approach to OCR using two-dimensional HMMs.  The work was
completed in 1998 and released to the public in 2001.  <p>

Iterated complete path search is a general speedup method for dynamic
programming which was invented by Gary Kopec and further developed in these
papers.  It can be applied to inference in many stochastic models,
including segmental HMMs.  <p>

The computation time of Document Image Decoding can be significantly
reduced by employing heuristics in the search for the best decoding of a
text line. By using a cheap upper bound on template match scores, up to
99.9% of the potential template matches can be avoided. In the Iterated
Complete Path method, template matches are performed only along the best
path found by dynamic programming on each iteration. When the best path
stabilizes, the decoding is optimal and no more template matches need be
performed. Computation can be further reduced in this scheme by exploiting
the incremental nature of the Viterbi iterations. Because only a few
trellis edge weights have changed since the last iteration, most of the
backpointers do not need to be updated. We describe how to quickly identify
these backpointers, without forfeiting optimality of the path. Together
these improvements provide a 30x speedup over previous implementations of
Document Image Decoding.

It has been shown that the computation time of Document Image Decoding can
be significantly reduced by employing heuristics in the search for the best
decoding of a text line. In the Iterated Complete Path (ICP) method,
template matches are performed only along the best path found by dynamic
programming on each iteration. When the best path stabilizes, the decoding
is optimal and no more template matches need be performed. In this way,
only a tiny fraction of potential template matches must be evaluated, and
the computation time is typically dominated by the evaluation of the
initial heuristic upper-bound for each template at each location in the
image.
<p>

The time to compute this bound depends on the resolution at which the
matching scores are found. At lower resolution, the heuristic computation
is reduced, but because a weaker bound is used, the number of Viterbi
iterations is increased. We present the optimal (lowest upper bound)
heuristic for any degree of subsampling of multilevel template and/or
interpolation, for use in text line decoding with ICP. The optimal degree
of subsampling depends on image quality, but it is typically found that a
small amount of template subsampling is effective in reducing the overall
decoding time.
