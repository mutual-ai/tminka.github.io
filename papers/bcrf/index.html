We propose Bayesian Conditional Random Fields (BCRFs) for classifying
interdependent and structured data, such as sequences, images or webs.
BCRFs are a Bayesian approach to training and inference with conditional
random fields, which were previously trained by maximizing likelihood (ML)
(Lafferty et al., 2001).  Our framework eliminates the problem of
overfitting, and offers the full advantages of a Bayesian treatment.
Unlike the ML approach, we estimate the posterior distribution of the model
parameters during training, and average over this posterior during
inference.  We apply an extension of EP method, the power EP method, to
incorporate the partition function. For algorithmic stability and accuracy,
we flatten the approximation structures to avoid two-level approximations.
We demonstrate the superior prediction accuracy of BCRFs over conditional
random fields trained with ML or MAP on synthetic and real
datasets.

      Hand-drawn diagrams present a complex recognition problem.  Elements
      of the diagram are often individually ambiguous, and require context
      to be interpreted.

      We present a recognition method based on Bayesian conditional random
      fields (BCRFs) that jointly analyzes all drawing elements in order to
      incorporate contextual cues. The classification of each object
      affects the classification of its neighbors. BCRFs allow flexible and
      correlated features, and take both spatial and temporal information
      into account.  BCRFs estimate the posterior distribution of
      parameters during training, and average predictions over the
      posterior for testing. As a result of model averaging, BCRFs avoid
      the overfitting problems associated with maximum likelihood
      training. We also incorporate Automatic Relevance Determination
      (ARD), a Bayesian feature selection technique, into BCRFs.  The
      result is significantly lower error rates compared to ML- and
      MAP-trained CRFs.
