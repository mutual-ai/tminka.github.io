<h1>Tree-structured approximations by expectation propagation</h1>

Approximation structure plays an important role in inference on loopy
graphs. As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in
the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential
projection method of Frey et al. (2000).  However, belief propagation
represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages.
In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with
tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework.  That
is, each factor sends a "message" to all pairs of nodes in a tree
structure.  The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent
convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than
variational trees or double-loop algorithms.

The potentials for the graphs used in the paper are available.

This is the example 4-node complete graph:

Each line of this file is a potential.  The first two columns give the
domain and the last four give the values.
The Matlab file read_pots.m will read this into BNT. </p>
