<h1>Linear regression with errors in both variables: A proper Bayesian approach</h1>

Thomas P. Minka<br>
MIT Media Lab note (10/8/99)
<p>

Linear regression with errors in both variables is a common modeling
problem with a 100-year literature, yet we have still not achieved the
widespread use of a complete and correct solution.  Much of this is due to
a confusion between joint and conditional modeling and an unhealthy
aversion to priors.  This paper expands on the proper Bayesian method of
Zellner (1971) and Gull (1989), deriving specific parameter estimators and
giving an analysis of their performance.  They are shown to perform
favorably compared to total least squares.  <p>

(This is an "executive summary", which only covers the univariate case
and does not give all equations and derivations.
The longer version is in limbo until I find time and interest to finish it.)
