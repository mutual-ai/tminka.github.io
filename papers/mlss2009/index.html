<h1>Probabilistic Programming with Infer.NET</h1>

John Winn and Tom Minka, 2009

<p>
Probabilistic Programming is a way of defining probabilistic models by overloading the operations in standard programming language to have probabilistic meanings.  The goal is to specify probabilistic models in a compact manner for human communication and in a precise manner for automatic inference.  A good overview of the research in this area can be found at <a href="http://probabilistic-programming.org/">probabilistic-programming.org</a>.
</p>

This is a talk and a series of exercises in Probabilistic Programming that we presented at the 
<a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/mlss09/schedule.htm">Machine Learning Summer School 2009</a>.
The exercises provide a hands-on introduction to the power of Probabilistic Programming and a tutorial in Infer.NET.
The original exercises required an old version of <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/infernet/">Infer.NET</a> that is no longer available.
