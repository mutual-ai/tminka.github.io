<h1>Independence Diagrams</h1>

Thomas Minka<br>
(1998)<p>

Independence diagrams are a graphical way of expressing the conditional
independence relationships among a set of random variables.  They cannot
encode every possible form of conditional independence but they go a long
way toward this end.  They are also called ``Bayesian networks,'' which
unfortunately suggests inappropriate comparisons to neural networks.  This
paper discusses how to read and write independence diagrams.  The
presentation is based on Pearl (1988).
