<h1>Expectation-Maximization as lower bound maximization</h1>

Thomas Minka<br>
(1998; revised 11/29/99)<p>

The Expectation-Maximization algorithm given by Dempster et al (1977) has
enjoyed considerable popularity for solving MAP estimation problems.  This
note derives EM from the lower bounding viewpoint (Luttrell, 1994), which
better illustrates the convergence properties of the algorithm and its
variants.  The algorithm is illustrated with two examples: pooling data
from multiple noisy sources and fitting a mixture density.  <p>
