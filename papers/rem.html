<h1>Using lower bounds to approximate integrals</h1>

Variational lower bounds are a simple and efficient way to approximate
Bayesian integrals.  By bounding the integrand at every point, we obtain a
bound on the integral value.  Variational Bayes (Attias 1999) and convex
duality methods (Jaakkola 1999a,b) are of this type, and---as shown in this
paper---so is the approximation method of Cheeseman &amp; Stutz (1996).  In
each case, EM is used to maximize the bound.  The EM updates are derived
for Gaussian mixtures and multinomial mixtures with conjugate priors.
Experimental results show the lower bound method to be less accurate than
Laplace's method, but often simpler.
