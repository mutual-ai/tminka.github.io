GBP and EP are two successful algorithms for approximate probabilistic
inference, which are based on different approximation strategies.  An open
problem in both algorithms has been how to choose an appropriate
approximation structure.  We introduce ``structured region graphs,'' a
formalism which marries these two strategies, reveals a deep connection
between them, and suggests how to choose good approximation structures. In
this formalism, each region has an internal structure which defines an
exponential family, whose sufficient statistics must be matched by the
parent region. Reduction operators on these structures allow conversion
between EP and GBP free energies.  Thus it is revealed that all EP
approximations on discrete variables are special cases of GBP, and
conversely that some well-known GBP approximations, such as overlapping
squares, are special cases of EP.  Furthermore, region graphs derived from
EP have a number of good structural properties, including maxent-normality
and overall counting number of one.  The result is a convenient framework
for producing high-quality approximations with a user-adjustable level of
complexity.
