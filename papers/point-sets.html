<h1>Learning How to Learn is Learning With Point Sets</h1>

This paper develops a simple interpretation of learning how to learn:
it is ordinary learning, but from point sets, rather than points.
This is an alternative to the Bayesian viewpoint of ``learning a
prior'' (Baxter, 1996b).  The idea behind learning how to learn is to
partition the data into separate learning tasks, learn a model for the
tasks, and then apply this model to new tasks.  Ordinary learning
methods do the same thing, but with individual data points as the
``tasks.''  The partitioning for learning how to learn can be
recovered automatically, generalizing the idea of ``task clustering''
(Thrun and O'Sullivan, 1996).  Virtually all existing algorithms fit
naturally into this unifying framework, including learning a distance
metric and learning internal representations.
